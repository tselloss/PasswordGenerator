# PasswordGenerator
I had some problems with my passwords and thus I create a simple code on Python to create a strong Passwords or Pass that the lenght is given from the user.

By default the code gives 18 characters(6 letters + 6 numbers + 6 symbols). 


Here I have a graph that we can check how strong is the password that we choose.
